# Plankton
A small OpenGL game library made for educational purposes.\
This project is in very-very early development stage.\
\
Since I'm still new to OpenGL, this library probably won't be as efficient as other.
But I still intend to make this library usable and also make it good enough to get in my top 5 game libraries to use.
